# 1.6 Introduction to Graphs and Charts

Graphs and charts are visual tools used to represent data and relationships between variables. This section covers the basics of reading and plotting points, various types of graphs such as bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts, and the fundamentals of linear graphs.

## Reading and Plotting Points on the Coordinate Plane

The coordinate plane consists of two axes: the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the vertical axis (y-axis). Each point on the plane is represented by an ordered pair \((x, y)\), where:

```math
x = \text{horizontal position} \\
y = \text{vertical position}
```

To plot a point, find its horizontal position on the x-axis and its vertical position on the y-axis, then mark where the two values meet.

### Example:
The point \((3, 4)\) is plotted by moving 3 units to the right along the x-axis and 4 units up along the y-axis.

## Bar Graphs, Line Graphs, and Pie Charts

### Bar Graphs:
A bar graph is used to display data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents.

### Line Graphs:
A line graph is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points called 'markers,' connected by straight line segments. It's typically used to show trends over time.

### Pie Charts:
A pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, illustrating numerical proportions. Each sector's arc length is proportional to the quantity it represents.

## Basics of Linear Graphs

A linear graph represents a linear equation in two variables. The general form of a linear equation is:

```math
y = mx + b
```

Where:
- \(m\) is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change.
- \(b\) is the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Example:
For the equation \(y = 2x + 1\), the slope \(m = 2\) means that for every unit increase in \(x\), \(y\) increases by 2. The y-intercept \(b = 1\) indicates the line crosses the y-axis at \(y = 1\).

### Graphing Linear Equations:
1. Identify the y-intercept \(b\).
2. Use the slope \(m\) to determine how the line progresses.
3. Plot additional points and connect them with a straight line.

```math
\text{Example: For } y = -x + 2
\text{Slope } m = -1, \text{ y-intercept } b = 2
```

This line would pass through the point \((0, 2)\) and slope downwards as \(x\) increases.
