### 1.3 Basic Algebraic Concepts

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. These symbols, called **variables**, can take on different values, while **constants** are fixed values. Mastering basic algebraic concepts is essential for solving a variety of mathematical problems. Below are some foundational ideas in algebra.

#### Variables and Constants

- **Variables**: Symbols, usually letters like \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \), used to represent unknown or changeable quantities. For example, in the equation:

```math
x + 2 = 5
```

\( x \) is the variable.
  
- **Constants**: Fixed values that do not change. For example, in the equation:

```math
x + 2 = 5
```

the numbers \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) are constants.

Variables can represent different values in different situations, while constants always have the same value. When writing equations, constants and variables work together to describe mathematical relationships.

#### Simplifying Expressions

Simplifying algebraic expressions involves combining like terms and performing operations to make the expression easier to work with.

For example:

```math
3x + 2x = 5x
```

(combining like terms)

```math
6y - 4 + 3y + 2 = 9y - 2
```

(combining like terms and constants)

When simplifying, always look for common terms (terms with the same variable and power) and reduce the expression to its simplest form.

#### Solving Simple Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation where the variable is raised to the first power (i.e., \( x \), not \( x^2 \) or higher). The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

**Steps for solving a simple linear equation**:
1. **Isolate the variable**: Move the terms involving the variable to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side.
2. **Simplify both sides**: Combine like terms if needed.
3. **Solve for the variable**: Perform operations to get the variable by itself.

Example:

```math
2x + 5 = 11
```

- Subtract 5 from both sides: 

```math
2x = 6
```

- Divide by 2: 

```math
x = 3
```

#### Introduction to Inequalities

An inequality is like an equation but shows that one side is greater or less than the other, rather than equal. The symbols used in inequalities are:
- \( > \) (greater than)
- \( < \) (less than)
- \( \geq \) (greater than or equal to)
- \( \leq \) (less than or equal to)

For example, \( x > 3 \) means \( x \) is any number greater than 3. Inequalities can be solved similarly to equations, but be careful: when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign.

Example:

```math
3x - 4 < 11
```

- Add 4 to both sides: 

```math
3x < 15
```

- Divide by 3: 

```math
x < 5
```

#### Word Problems Involving Algebra

Word problems use real-world scenarios to describe relationships between variables. To solve these problems:
1. **Understand the problem**: Identify the quantities involved and what is being asked.
2. **Translate into an equation**: Convert the words into an algebraic equation using variables.
3. **Solve the equation**: Use algebraic methods to find the value of the variable.
4. **Interpret the solution**: Make sure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

Example:

A car rental company charges a base fee of $20 plus $5 per hour. If the total cost for renting the car is $45, how many hours was the car rented?

Let \( h \) represent the number of hours rented.

The equation is:

```math
20 + 5h = 45
```

Solving for \( h \):

```math
5h = 45 - 20 = 25
```

```math
h = \frac{25}{5} = 5
```

The car was rented for 5 hours.
