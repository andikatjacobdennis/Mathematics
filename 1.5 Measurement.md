### 1.5 Measurement

Measurement is a fundamental concept in physics and mathematics, allowing us to quantify physical quantities such as length, area, volume, and time. Understanding units of measurement and their conversions is crucial for solving problems accurately.

#### Units of Measurement

##### Length
Length measures the distance between two points and is one of the basic physical quantities. Units of length include:
- **Metric System**: Millimeters (mm), Centimeters (cm), Meters (m), Kilometers (km)
- **Imperial System**: Inches (in), Feet (ft), Yards (yd), Miles (mi)

```math
1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ centimeters} = 1000 \text{ millimeters}
```

```math
1 \text{ mile} = 5280 \text{ feet} = 1760 \text{ yards} = 63360 \text{ inches}
```

##### Area
Area refers to the surface covered by a shape, measured in square units. Common units include:
- **Metric System**: Square Centimeters (cm²), Square Meters (m²), Hectares (ha)
- **Imperial System**: Square Inches (in²), Square Feet (ft²), Acres

```math
1 \text{ hectare} = 10,000 \text{ square meters}
```

```math
1 \text{ acre} = 43,560 \text{ square feet}
```

##### Volume
Volume measures the space occupied by an object. It is expressed in cubic units for solid objects and in liters or gallons for liquids:
- **Metric System**: Cubic Centimeters (cm³), Cubic Meters (m³), Liters (L)
- **Imperial System**: Cubic Inches (in³), Cubic Feet (ft³), Gallons

```math
1 \text{ liter} = 1000 \text{ cubic centimeters}
```

```math
1 \text{ gallon (US)} = 231 \text{ cubic inches}
```

#### Conversion Between Units (Metric and Imperial Systems)

Unit conversions are essential when dealing with different measurement systems. Some common conversions include:

- **Length**:  
  ```math
  1 \text{ inch} = 2.54 \text{ cm}
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ foot} = 30.48 \text{ cm}
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ meter} = 3.28084 \text{ feet}
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ kilometer} = 0.621371 \text{ miles}
  ```

- **Area**:  
  ```math
  1 \text{ square inch} = 6.4516 \text{ cm}^2
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ square foot} = 929.0304 \text{ cm}^2
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ square meter} = 10.7639 \text{ square feet}
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ hectare} = 2.47105 \text{ acres}
  ```

- **Volume**:  
  ```math
  1 \text{ cubic inch} = 16.387 \text{ cm}^3
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ cubic foot} = 28.3168 \text{ liters}
  ```
  ```math
  1 \text{ liter} = 0.264172 \text{ gallons (US)}
  ```

#### Time, Speed, and Distance Calculations

Time, speed, and distance are often related through the formula:  
```math
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
```

- **Speed**: Measured in units like meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), or miles per hour (mph).
- **Distance**: The total path traveled, measured in meters, kilometers, miles, etc.
- **Time**: Measured in seconds, minutes, or hours.

##### Example:
If a car travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, the speed is:  
```math
\text{Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ km/h}
```

##### Conversion Example:
To convert 60 km/h to meters per second:  
```math
1 \text{ km/h} = \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = 0.27778 \text{ m/s}
```

```math
\text{Speed in m/s} = 60 \times 0.27778 = 16.67 \text{ m/s}
```

Understanding these basic units and conversion methods is crucial for solving practical problems in physics, engineering, and everyday life.
