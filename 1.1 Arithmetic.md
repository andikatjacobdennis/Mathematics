# Arithmetic

Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers and their operations. It is foundational for all areas of mathematics and has numerous applications in everyday life.

## 1. Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers

- **Natural Numbers**: The set of positive integers starting from 1, i.e., \( \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \). Natural numbers are used for counting.

- **Whole Numbers**: The set of natural numbers including zero, i.e., \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\} \). Whole numbers are used for counting and representing whole quantities.

- **Integers**: The set of whole numbers and their negatives, i.e., \( \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\} \). Integers can represent both positive and negative quantities.

## 2. Fractions and Decimals

- **Fractions**: A fraction represents a part of a whole and is written as \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) is the numerator and \( b \) is the denominator. Examples include \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \).

- **Decimals**: A decimal is another way to represent fractions and uses a point to separate the whole part from the fractional part. For example, \( 0.5 \) represents \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( 0.75 \) represents \( \frac{3}{4} \).

## 3. Factors and Multiples (LCM, GCD)

- **Factors**: A factor of a number is an integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder. For example, the factors of 12 are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \).

- **Multiples**: A multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For instance, the first few multiples of 5 are \( 5, 10, 15, 20, \dots \).

- **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The smallest multiple that two or more numbers share. For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.

- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The largest factor that two or more numbers share. For example, the GCD of 12 and 15 is 3.

## 4. Prime Numbers and Prime Factorization

- **Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

- **Prime Factorization**: The process of breaking down a composite number into its prime factors. For instance, the prime factorization of 18 is \( 2 \times 3^2 \).

## 5. Divisibility Rules

Divisibility rules help determine whether one number is divisible by another without performing division. Here are some common rules:

- A number is divisible by 2 if it is even (last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
- A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
- A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
- A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.

## 6. Powers, Roots, and Exponents

- **Powers**: A power is the result of raising a number to an exponent. For example, \( 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \).

- **Roots**: The root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself a certain number of times, gives the original number. For example, \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

- **Exponents**: The exponent indicates how many times a number is multiplied by itself. For example, in \( 5^4 \), 5 is the base and 4 is the exponent.

## 7. Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

To solve arithmetic expressions correctly, the order of operations must be followed:

- **PEMDAS** (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).
- **BODMAS** (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

For example, in the expression \( 3 + 5 \times (2^2 - 1) \), calculate the exponent first, then perform multiplication, followed by addition.

## 8. Percentage, Ratio, and Proportion

- **Percentage**: A percentage represents a fraction out of 100. For example, \( 25\% \) means 25 out of 100.

- **Ratio**: A ratio compares two quantities and shows the relative size of one quantity to another. For instance, the ratio of 2 to 3 is written as \( 2:3 \).

- **Proportion**: A proportion states that two ratios are equal. For example, if \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \), then \( a \) is to \( b \) as \( c \) is to \( d \).

## 9. Rounding and Estimation

- **Rounding**: Rounding is the process of reducing the digits in a number while keeping its value similar. For example, \( 4.67 \) rounded to the nearest whole number is 5.

- **Estimation**: Estimation involves making an approximate calculation or judgment about a number. This can simplify calculations, especially when precision is not required.

## 10. Arithmetic Word Problems

Arithmetic word problems involve applying arithmetic operations to solve problems presented in narrative form. To solve these, follow these steps:

1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Identify the information given and what is being asked.
3. Choose the appropriate operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4. Translate the words into mathematical expressions or equations.
5. Solve the equation and interpret the answer in the context of the problem.

### Example:

*Problem*: If a shirt costs $20 and you buy 3 shirts, how much will it cost in total?

*Solution*: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \). The total cost is $60.
