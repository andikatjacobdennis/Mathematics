### 1.4 Basic Geometry

#### Points, Lines, Angles

- **Points**: A point represents an exact location in space and has no size or dimension.
- **Lines**: A line is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions. It is defined by two points.
- **Angles**: An angle is formed when two rays meet at a common endpoint called a vertex. The space between the two rays is measured in degrees.

#### Types of Angles

- **Acute Angle**: An angle that measures less than 90°.
- **Right Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 90°.
- **Obtuse Angle**: An angle that measures more than 90° but less than 180°.

#### Properties of Triangles and Polygons

- **Triangles**:
  - A triangle has three sides, three angles, and three vertices.
  - The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180°.
  - **Types of Triangles**:
    - **Equilateral Triangle**: All sides and angles are equal.
    - **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are also equal.
    - **Scalene Triangle**: All sides and angles are different.
  
- **Polygons**:
  - A polygon is a closed figure formed by straight lines.
  - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:

  ```math
  \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
  ```

  - **Types of Polygons**:
    - **Quadrilateral**: A four-sided polygon.
    - **Pentagon**: A five-sided polygon.
    - **Hexagon**: A six-sided polygon, and so on.

#### Perimeter and Area of Basic Shapes

- **Square**:
  - **Perimeter**: 

  ```math
  P = 4 \times \text{side}
  ```

  - **Area**: 

  ```math
  A = \text{side}^2
  ```

- **Rectangle**:
  - **Perimeter**: 

  ```math
  P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
  ```

  - **Area**: 

  ```math
  A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
  ```

- **Triangle**:
  - **Perimeter**: 

  ```math
  P = \text{side}_1 + \text{side}_2 + \text{side}_3
  ```

  - **Area** (for a right-angled triangle):  

  ```math
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  ```

  For a general triangle (using Heron's formula):

  ```math
  A = \sqrt{s(s - \text{side}_1)(s - \text{side}_2)(s - \text{side}_3)}
  ```

  where 

  ```math
  s = \frac{\text{side}_1 + \text{side}_2 + \text{side}_3}{2}
  ```

  is the semi-perimeter.
