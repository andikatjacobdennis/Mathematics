### 1.2 Basic Number Theory

Number theory is a branch of mathematics focused on the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. Understanding the fundamental concepts of number theory is essential for various mathematical applications, including cryptography, computer science, and algebra. This section covers several basic concepts in number theory: even and odd numbers, prime and composite numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD), the least common multiple (LCM), and modular arithmetic.

#### Even and Odd Numbers

Numbers can be classified into two categories: even and odd. 

- **Even Numbers**: An integer is considered even if it is divisible by 2, meaning it can be expressed in the form \( n = 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer. Examples of even numbers include -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, and so on.

- **Odd Numbers**: An integer is considered odd if it is not divisible by 2, which can be expressed in the form \( n = 2k + 1 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Examples of odd numbers include -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, and so on.

The sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers is always even, while the sum of an even number and an odd number is always odd.

#### Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers

Numbers can also be classified based on their divisibility properties:

- **Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so forth. Notably, 2 is the only even prime number.

- **Composite Numbers**: A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors, meaning it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself. Examples of composite numbers include 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers (up to the order of the factors).

#### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD of two numbers, you can use various methods:

1. **Prime Factorization**: Factor both numbers into their prime factors and multiply the common factors.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: This efficient method involves repeated division:
   - If \( a \) and \( b \) are two integers, the GCD can be found using the formula:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(a, b) = \text{GCD}(b, a \mod b)
     \]
   - This process continues until \( b \) becomes 0; at that point, \( a \) will be the GCD.

#### Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers.

To find the LCM of two numbers, you can use the following methods:

1. **Prime Factorization**: Factor both numbers into their prime factors, and take the highest power of each prime factor that appears.

2. **Relation between GCD and LCM**: The LCM can also be calculated using the GCD:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]

#### Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value known as the modulus. 

In modular arithmetic, we write \( a \equiv b \mod m \) to mean that \( a \) and \( b \) leave the same remainder when divided by \( m \). For example:

- \( 17 \equiv 5 \mod 12 \) because both 17 and 5 leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 12.

Key properties of modular arithmetic include:

- **Addition**: \( (a + b) \mod m \)
- **Subtraction**: \( (a - b) \mod m \)
- **Multiplication**: \( (a \cdot b) \mod m \)
- **Exponentiation**: \( (a^b) \mod m \)

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, particularly in algorithms and cryptography, as it helps manage large numbers efficiently and securely.
