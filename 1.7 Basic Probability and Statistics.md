### 1.7 Basic Probability and Statistics

#### Introduction to Probability (Simple Events)
Probability is the study of uncertainty and quantifies the likelihood of certain events occurring. A **simple event** is a single outcome from a probability experiment. For any event \( A \), the probability of the event occurring is represented as \( P(A) \) and is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

```math
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
```

- **Example**: If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 3 is:

```math
P(\text{rolling a 3}) = \frac{1}{6}
```

#### Mean, Median, Mode, and Range
These are basic measures of central tendency and dispersion in data sets:

1. **Mean** (Arithmetic Average): The sum of all data values divided by the total number of values.

```math
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
```

- Example: For the data set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, the mean is:

```math
\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3
```

2. **Median**: The middle value in a sorted data set. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   - Example: For the data set \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}, the median is 5. If the data set is \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, the median is:

```math
\frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5
```

3. **Mode**: The value(s) that appear most frequently in a data set. A data set can have more than one mode or no mode at all.
   - Example: For the data set \{1, 2, 2, 3, 4\}, the mode is 2.

4. **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set.

```math
\text{Range} = \text{Max value} - \text{Min value}
```

- Example: For the data set \{3, 7, 8, 2, 10\}, the range is:

```math
10 - 2 = 8
```

#### Simple Data Sets and Frequency Tables
A frequency table is used to organize and display the number of times each value occurs in a data set. The table lists data values alongside their corresponding frequencies.

- **Example**: Given the data set \{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5\}, the frequency table would look like:

| Value | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
|   1   |     1     |
|   2   |     2     |
|   3   |     3     |
|   4   |     1     |
|   5   |     1     |

#### Basic Combinatorics
Combinatorics deals with counting and arranging objects. It forms the basis of probability calculations for compound events.

1. **Factorials**: The factorial of a number \(n\), denoted as \(n!\), is the product of all positive integers up to \(n\).

```math
n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1
```

- Example: 

```math
4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
```

2. **Permutations**: The number of ways to arrange \(r\) objects from a set of \(n\) distinct objects.

```math
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
```

- Example: The number of ways to arrange 3 objects from a set of 5 is:

```math
P(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{1} = 60
```

3. **Combinations**: The number of ways to choose \(r\) objects from a set of \(n\) distinct objects, where order does not matter.

```math
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
```

- Example: The number of ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 4 is:

```math
C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
```
